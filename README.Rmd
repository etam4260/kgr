## Introduction

The goal of kgr is to provide an interface for building and maintaining 
knowledge graphs in R. Knowledge graphs are powerful data structures for 
representing relationships among entities. Currently, R lack the 
tools necessary for working with knowledge graphs effectively in an intuitive
manner.

kgr provides a GUI for creating knowledge graphs directly in RStudio and allows 
users to directly link to data together. It also allows users to easily 
define and store their data frames and tibbles in graph like structures. 

Users are able to export their knowledge graphs to tools such as neo4j or 
save it directly into their local environment for future use. This tool also 
provides access to common graph algorithms and graph munging tools.

## The Growing Trend of Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs have gained a lot of attention 
in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing.
Harvesting knowledge from large amounts of data relies on technology which
can interpret relationships among entities efficiently (). The ability to embed 
knowledge is important for knowledge representation. The rising popularity 
of knowledge graphs are due to their high compatible with deep learning 
methods which have led to breakthrough technologies in many fields ().

According to Noy et al, they are critical to many enterprises and provide 
structured data and knowledge that drives products and make them smarter ().

## Knowledge Graphs versus Relational Databases

Knowledge graphs are used by Google to enhance its search engine's results with
information from a wide variety of sources. Furthermore, contemporary 
information systems in various sectors currently use DBMS or relational 
databases as part of their business systems. Although relational databases
are deeply embedded into contemporary technologies, operations 
are expensive when compared to graphs due to expensive join operations ().

Graph databases, on the other hand, utilize the connection of nodes and 
relationships in a unified manner, making it simple to build models 
which closely follow a problem domain. This allows a user to query and
map data from many perspectives as graphs provide more flexibility and are not 
bounded by strict table or column layouts (). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of kgr like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etam4260/kgr")
```
